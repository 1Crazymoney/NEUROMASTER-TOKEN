#  Deloitte CIS and Waves Platform Partnership [First announced 2018] Taken from original interview
  
- Waves Leading developer of blockchain solutions, signed a memorandum on strategic partnership.
  
The partnership is aimed at providing clients with comprehensive initial coin offering (ICO) services 
and customized blockchain solutions tailored for specific business tasks.

Deloitte focuses on application of innovative approaches in its operations and realizes how important 
it is to develop the digital economy. Under this memorandum, Deloitte’s experts, who possess extensive
legal and tax expertise in implementing technology projects, will provide the necessary consulting and
methodology assistance to businesses and government bodies alike. We will also communicate long-term
advantages and opportunities for the companies implementing digital technologies.
  
In addition to that, one of our objectives is to develop the legal mechanisms for regulating ICO projects. 
  Curently no such mechanisms exist in the market. This will help the companies to safeguard themselves 
  from project risks and challenges after they complete the initial offering of tokens.  
  
“Blockchain technologies are gaining ground, already allowing start-ups, investors and other stakeholders to 
  quickly raise significant funds in cryptocurrencies. However, the cryptocurrency market is relatively young, 
  and not all the regulatory mechanisms are in place. This is why we are glad to cooperate with Waves Platform 
  and are confident that our joint effort will help create the necessary conditions for putting together the 
  legal framework for blockchain projects both in Russia and the CIS,” says Artem Tolkachev, Director of 
  Legal Services for Technology Projects at Deloitte CIS.
  
“Our partnership is a significant step towards mass application of blockchain technology. Presently, 
  blockchain companies are not regulated, as there is no existing legislation as such. Our strategic 
  partnership with Deloitte will allow us to take active part in the formation of this regulatory landscape. 
  
  It is important to join this process both for us and the entire blockchain industry in Russia and the CIS,” 
  Waves founder and CEO Sasha Ivanov says.
