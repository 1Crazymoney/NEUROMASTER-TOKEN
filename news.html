Neutrino protocol is the latest project to announce an integration with the Chainlink network, 
an update that comes on the back of a long line of developments in the latter's ecosystem. 
This integration will help Neutrino transfer its stablecoin Neutrino Dollar [USDN], along 
with other tokens, between the two blockchains.
