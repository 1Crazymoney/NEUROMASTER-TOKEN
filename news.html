# Future of Waves  

# UPDATE - WAVES token has been ported to Ethereum [ETH] #unspoppable

***
Waves.tech, an ecosystem of next-generation technologies built on the Waves protocol, has ported its native token WAVES into 
Ethereum to enhance interoperability between the two networks and introduce Waves functionality to Ethereum users. 

WAVES token holders will have access to numerous decentralized applications, exchanges, and DeFi protocols operating on the 
Ethereum blockchain, whose users, in turn, will gain easy access to the WAVES coin. In particular, WAVES pools will become 
available on Uniswap, Mooniswap and Curve.

The Waves-Ethereum gateway is available through the Waves.Exchange interface. In order to issue one ERC-20 WAVES, 
users have to lock one WAVES on the Waves blockchain. Converting tokens from Ethereum back to Waves is also possible.
The address of ERC-20 WAVES smart contract is 0x1cf4592ebffd730c7dc92c1bdffdfc3b9efcf29a.ADVERTISEMENT

In 2021, the gateway will be operated through Gravity, a data protocol that connects disparate blockchains with a truly 
agnostic and untokenized hub, acting as an oracle between systems. The Waves team is also going to implement the option 
of staking WAVES tokens directly from Ethereum wallets.

“Ethereum is the leading blockchain by the number of dApp users,” says Sasha Ivanov, Waves founder. “The emergence of the 
WAVES token in ERC-20 format provides new opportunities for interaction between the two ecosystems. Some tokens on the Waves 
blockchain have already been accessible in the Ethereum network for a couple of months, and we see a growing demand for them. 
This is an example of working cross-chain interoperability which has been so much discussed recently.”

Earlier this year, Waves announced the porting of two tokens into the Ethereum network — Neutrino USD (USDN), 
an algorithmic dollar-pegged stablecoin, and Neutrino System Base Token (NSBT), a system and governance token for the 
Neutrino protocol, running on the Waves blockchain. So far, about 13.7 million USDN have been transferred to 
Ethereum and are available in the pools of major DeFi protocols, such as Uniswap, 1inch and Curve.

#  Deloitte CIS and Waves Platform Partnership [First announced 2017] Taken from original interview
  
- Waves Leading developer of blockchain solutions, signed a memorandum on strategic partnership.
  
The partnership is aimed at providing clients with comprehensive initial coin offering (ICO) services 
and customized blockchain solutions tailored for specific business tasks.

Deloitte focuses on application of innovative approaches in its operations and realizes how important 
it is to develop the digital economy. Under this memorandum, Deloitte’s experts, who possess extensive
legal and tax expertise in implementing technology projects, will provide the necessary consulting and
methodology assistance to businesses and government bodies alike. We will also communicate long-term
advantages and opportunities for the companies implementing digital technologies.
  
In addition to that, one of our objectives is to develop the legal mechanisms for regulating ICO projects. 
  Curently no such mechanisms exist in the market. This will help the companies to safeguard themselves 
  from project risks and challenges after they complete the initial offering of tokens.  
  
“Blockchain technologies are gaining ground, already allowing start-ups, investors and other stakeholders to 
  quickly raise significant funds in cryptocurrencies. However, the cryptocurrency market is relatively young, 
  and not all the regulatory mechanisms are in place. This is why we are glad to cooperate with Waves Platform 
  and are confident that our joint effort will help create the necessary conditions for putting together the 
  legal framework for blockchain projects both in Russia and the CIS,” says Artem Tolkachev, Director of 
  Legal Services for Technology Projects at Deloitte CIS.
  
“Our partnership is a significant step towards mass application of blockchain technology. Presently, 
  blockchain companies are not regulated, as there is no existing legislation as such. Our strategic 
  partnership with Deloitte will allow us to take active part in the formation of this regulatory landscape. 
  
  It is important to join this process both for us and the entire blockchain industry in Russia and the CIS,” 
  Waves founder and CEO Sasha Ivanov says.
